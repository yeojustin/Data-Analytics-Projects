# Machine-Learning-Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This is where I upload all my external projects and competition entries. Feel free to explore the projects listed in the root folder. Please note that this repository is a work in progress, and I'm continually adding new content.

## What's Inside?

- **What am I working on now?**: Currently, I'm actively working on projects related to k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), regression, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 

- **ML Coursework Stuff**: Contains all the projects and work directly related to my ML coursework.
